# Responsive Web Portfolio

Welcome to my web portfolio, a project entirely created in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. This site is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal experience on all types of devices. I also use icons from **BoxIcons** to enrich the appearance and navigation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) thanks to media query techniques and a flexible layout.
- **HTML & CSS**: Semantic structure and modern styles for an elegant interface.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactions, animations and improvement of the user experience.
- **BoxIcons**: Modern and light icons for intuitive navigation.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, media queries, animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features for smooth navigation.
- **BoxIcons**: Collection of integrated vector icons to improve aesthetics and navigation.
